# AEM Training - Day 8 Assignment (27-03-2025) 


### 1. What is MSM, Blueprint, Live Copy, and Rollout?

#### **Multi-Site Management (MSM)**
MSM in AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) allows content authors to manage multiple sites efficiently by creating a relationship between a master site and its copies.

- **Blueprint**: The original source of the content that is copied into other sites.
- **Live Copy**: A copy of the Blueprint that is linked and can receive updates through Rollouts.
- **Rollout**: The action of propagating changes from the Blueprint to the Live Copy.

##### **Use Case**
For example, if we have a master website `/content/us/en`, we can create country-specific sites (`/content/ca/en`, `/content/uk/en`) using MSM. Changes made in `/content/us/en` can be rolled out to other sites.

### 2. What is Language Copy?
A **Language Copy** is a translated version of a site for different language locales. It helps in creating multilingual websites without duplicating content manually.

Example:
```
/content/us/en (English)
/content/us/fr (French)
/content/us/es (Spanish)
```
AEM provides translation tools to help with managing language copies.
